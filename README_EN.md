### About"OpenCore_EFI_202104"(04-2021)

From this version, EFI has been replaced with OpenCore from the original Clover. This version of EFI has removed many deprecated drivers, updated the necessary drivers, and added Intel AC9560 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers, making the hackintosh closer to perfection. One problem that still exists is that it will automatically wake up after a period of sleep. It is initially suspected that the wake-up is caused by the wireless network card. The cause of this problem is still to be confirmed. If you find a solution to this problem, please tell me. Regarding the migration process this time, I also recorded it in my blog. If you also want to migrate from Clover to OpenCore, you can refer to my migration process and click [here](https://fisher.lazybone.xyz/%E4%BB%8Eclover%E8%BF%81%E7%A7%BB%E5%88%B0opencore.html)  to check out my blog.

Note: This EFI does not remove the configuration of my model, please change this part of the configuration according to your own model.



### About"å®Œç¾ŽEFI_202104"(04-2021)

This version of EFI is based on the 11-2019 version of EFI. It has updated some drivers and added drivers for Intel AC 9560 wireless network card and Bluetooth(itlwn and IntelBluetoothFirmware). However, this driver needs to be forced to be loaded under Clover. In order to minimize the injection of the system, my Clover Bootloader has been replaced with a newer OpenCore. Therefore, this EFI will be the last EFI of Clover and will not be updated in the future.



### About"å®Œç¾ŽEFI_201911"(11-2019)

"å®Œç¾ŽEFI_201911" is what I tried to configure after a week of research, adding the appropriate driver according to my own hardware. I didnâ€™t expect to try it once and succeeded. Thanks to the driver developer and the author of the tutorial! Many drivers are much simpler and more stable than in March 2019. This time the Hackintosh installation configuration process is recorded in my blog. -> [æ ‡ç­¾ï¼šHackintosh | Fisher's Blog](http://fisher.lazybone.xyz/tags/hackintosh/)

1. My first Boot was failed and the last line of the log is `PTIsensors:started`, and the problem solved after reboot. Maybe I am too anxious.ðŸ˜‚
2. The next system installation encountered a problem with `the application copy being corrupted and cannot be used to install macOS`. This problem is solved by disconnecting the network and modifying the system time.
3. The rest of the installed graphics driver has not encountered any problems, I remember that there will be an error when installing the driver in March 2019.

##### Test situationï¼š

- GPU -> OK
- Onboard wired network card -> OK
- Sound card -> OK
- Sleep awakening -> OK
- CPU Turbo -> OK
- Shutdown -> OK
- USB3.0 & USB3.1 -> OK

##### Solved Problems:

- Wireless network card didn't work -> (04-2021)Now we can use itlwn to solve this problem. In clover, the driver must be forced to load.

##### Test situation:

- GPU -> OK
- Onboard wired network card -> OK
- Sound card -> OK
- Sleep awakening -> Not tested
- CPU Turbo -> Not tested

##### Solved Problems:

+ Wireless network card didn't work -> (04-2021)Now we can use itlwn to solve this problem. In clover, the driver must be forced to load.



### About "GitHub_CLOVER(i5-8500_B360_1060)"(03-2019)

"GitHub_CLOVER(i5-8500_B360_1060)" was found in https://github.com/sqlsec/clover repository at March of 2019, there is no such EFI in the repo.

I can boot normally during the process of using it, But it seems to be stuck in the verbose mode during the installation process.

##### Problems:

+ Unable to shotdown -> Check "FixShutdown" in Clover Configurator
+ Sound card is not working properly -> Suspected to be a config.plist configuration issue, I solve it via https://hackintosher.com/guides/fix-asus-supremefx-s1220a-hackintosh-audio/
+ Onboard wired network card didn't work -> Should be built-in driver is not the latest  version
+ Wireless network card didn't work -> (04-2021)Now we can use itlwn to solve this problem. In clover, the driver must be forced to load.
